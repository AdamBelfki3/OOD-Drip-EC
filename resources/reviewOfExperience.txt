We spent quite a lot of time working on our design in assignment 5 and now,
more than ever, we truly understand the importance of having good design after
working with someone else’s implementation and having our implementation be used by someone else.
From the conversations we’ve had with our customers, it seems like they were able
to work with our code as it is without us having to make any modifications to it.
However, one minor change we would make to our design/implementation is that we would
add an interface for the view model so that our customers would be able to easily mimic
a view model to use as well.
This was a really interesting and fun experience and it gave us a taste of what we would
eventually be doing in the real world - practice working with implementations written by
someone else and working with strangers. Thankfully, our providers were very helpful and
responded to our questions almost instantly, so luckily we didn’t have any problems with
trying to piece together the implementation we were working with. Additionally, we just
needed a few interfaces from their code because we thought it was necessary for us to
complete the work, and they also sent us those interfaces almost immediately - this could’ve
easily turned out to be a disaster so we are glad that we got such helpful and responsive providers.
