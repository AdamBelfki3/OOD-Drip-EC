_ Step 1:
  > Modify the Animation Reader to take into consideration the tempo line

_ Step2:
  > Ensure values for the tempo intervals are legit values:
  in start animation:
    _ no interval is outside the start and end time of the animation
    _ no interval has a negative duration
    _ no intervals overlap

_ Step 3:
  > Find a way to check for the currentTick, when current Tick matches an interval starting time:
    _ update speed to 0.5, after the end of the interval, we take it back to its normal speed.
